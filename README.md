## <a id="ConsoleApp">ConsoleApp</a>

This sample simply shows how to use [Casdoor.Client](https://github.com/casdoor/casdoor-dotnet-sdk/tree/master/src/Casdoor.Client) package. It is an API client implementation for the Casdoor, used to call the Casdoor APIs.

### Quickstart

```
git clone https://github.com/casdoor/casdoor-dotnet-sdk-example.git
cd casdoor-dotnet-sdk-example
dotnet run --project ConsoleApp
```

Some information will be displayed on the console, which is from the `Program.cs` file and has been processed by Casdoor.

### Configuration

Now open `Program.cs` file and you can see the following code:

```c#
var httpClient = new HttpClient();
var options = new CasdoorOptions
{
    Endpoint = "https://door.casdoor.com",
    OrganizationName = "casbin",
    ApplicationName = "app-build-in",
    ApplicationType = "native",
    ClientId = "b800a86702dd4d29ec4d",
    ClientSecret = "1219843a8db4695155699be3a67f10796f2ec1d5",
    CallbackPath = "/callback",
    RequireHttpsMetadata = true,
    Scope = "openid profile email"
};
var client = new CasdoorClient(httpClient, options);
```

The meanings of some fields are explained as follows:

| Name                 | Must | Description                                                  |

### Quickstart

```bash
